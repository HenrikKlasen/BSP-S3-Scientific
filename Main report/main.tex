  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}

  \usepackage{cite} 
\fi 
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's

% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.

% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.

% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx


% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

With scientific endeavours becoming more cost intensive, there is a need to plan specific missions into minor details. In order of cutting cost to expensive missions, such as satellite launches and submarine drones, it is important to plan missions in high detail. Computational models can help to find the weak points of the mission, find extreme values of the devices and can help to set up a safe margin for the mission program. The development of one such computational model with a potential use case in space exploration is the topic of this Bachelor Semester Project.

\section{Introduction (190/400 words)}
% no \IEEEPARstart
The importance of simulations in the scientific world is rising. Not only do they provide a less cost-intensive way of testing real life scenarios in a virtual twin of the current model of the world, but they do so in a cost-effective way. It is cheaper for example, to test new aerodynamics concepts in a virtual environment, where they are well changeable, instead of using wind tunnels. For these wind tunnel tests, the components have to be produced, the wind tunnel has to be powered on and a large amount of energy has to be used for powering the wind tunnel. Not only is this way of testing resource exhaustive, but also not very environmentally friendly, as a big portion of these prototypes will end up as scrap and can partly not even be used any more.  \\
Simulations can provide near-real world environments, or at least emulate the behaviour of certain laws in physics. With these environments, we can reduce the amount of resources we use, by checking: is it the right way to achieve our goal? Can we optimize the behaviour of our test subject before producing it? 
\section{Project description ($\pm$ 10\% of total words) }
\subsection{Domains}
\subsubsection{Scientific}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Computational Modelling}: This domain is all about breaking down real life environments and behaviours into equations and algorithms for simulating the environment as good as possible with certain simplifications.
	\item \emph{Simulations}: Simulations are a computational approach to emulate real life behaviours of objects and environments on computers. They are used for example for optimizing the trajectories in space, simulating fluid dynamics or aerodynamics for optimizing the fuel efficiency of cars.
	\item \emph{Scientific Computing}: Scientific Computing is an interdisciplinary discipline bound to develop approaches for algorithms, models and software. These are used for simulating real world behaviour as close as possible. This means, that computational modelling and simulations are both a subset of scientific computing, which is the broader scientific topic. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Technical}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Unity}: A state of the art game engine for three dimensional and two dimensional games. With its powerful, built-in physics engine, it is able to also create realistic simulations, such as digital twinning, fluid simulations, as well as large field gravitational simulations, which is the goal in this project.
	\item \emph{Visual Studio}: A powerful code editor for all of the programming languages in the .NET Framework. This IDE has Unity integration, which simplifies the development of programs in Unity. 
	\item \emph{C\#}: An object-oriented, higher level programming language in the .NET framework, which was heavily influenced by C++ and Java. C\# is often used in cross-platform application development, game development and in Machine Learning applications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Targeted Deliverables}
\label{sec-deliverables}
\subsubsection{Scientific deliverables}
The scientific part of this Bachelor Semester Project is about modelling a suitable, simplified model of the solar system.\\
It will consist of three parts. The first part being about the fundamentals of computational modelling, which will take a look at the approach of breaking real world data down to a computable model. This model can be emulated by a computer program.\\
As the title of this Bachelor Semester Project implies, the second part of the scientific part is about modelling a model with some constraints and simplifications. This model will include the basics of orbital mechanics, as well as the fundamental concepts of Newtonian physics.\\ 
The scientific part will tackle the following scientific question: \emph{How can scientists model a simplified simulation of the solar system?} \\
To find a satisfying answer to this question, it is necessary to answer the related questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{What is a computational model?}: This question aims on answering the most basic and fundamental question of this project. The results of this question are required to later on build and model the computational model.
	\item \emph{What environmental factors of the solar system have to be considered?}: This question aims on answering, \emph{how} the model will look like. This includes the examination of the utilized simplifications, methodologies and an analysis of the factors influencing the selection of specific approaches.
	\item \emph{How can the model be modelled? }: With this question, the goal is to find equations and algorithms that facilitate an accurate representation of the computational model. This part is meant to include all the orbital mechanics theory needed. 
\end{itemize}
As the goal is to find satisfying answers to the questions above, a state-of-the-art study will be conducted. 
Based on this study, the subsequent resources are used to address the scientific question:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{PhysicsSimulationsLargeWorlds}: This publication is about the computational cost of large scale physics simulations. It will mainly be used in the section for the question "\emph{What environmental factors of the solar system have to be considered?}", as it is about modelling the computational model itself. 
	\item \cite{ComputationalModelling}: The main point in using this publication is to find out a way to properly model a computational model. It provides many examples for computational models for several different simulations, which might help when modelling the solar system later in the project.
	\item \cite{ScientificComputing}: This resource is about scientific computing. As its objective is to teach undergraduate students the fundamentals of scientific computing and numerical methods to model a simulation or whichever model needed, it is well suitable for this Bachelor Semester Project. It will be used for getting some insights on how scientific computing is used today and how it \emph{can} be used in this project.
\end{itemize}
With the use of these resources, the scientific part will focus on delivering the most useful and crucial information to develop a satisfying model of the solar system. The results of this part will later on be used in the technical part of this bachelor semester project, which is all about the implementation of a three dimensional solar system in Unity. In the last section of this part of the project, we will take a look at which factors cannot be simulated in the model developed and which parts could possibly be added in future extensions, but which exceed the scope of this project. \\
The overall goal of this deliverable is to ensure, that the reader can understand the design decisions in the technical part. The results of this section will be used as a fundamental basis of the technical deliverable and the implementation.

\subsubsection{Technical deliverables}
The technical part of this Bachelor Semester Project is about the implementation of the computational model developed in the scientific part. In fact, it is about the implementation of a virtual version of the solar system. \\
While the scientific part is more about the "\emph{What do we want to simulate?}", this part is more about the "\emph{How do we implement what we want to simulate?}". The goal with this deliverable is, to get to know how to implement scientific computing models in a given environment. \\
As for the technical deliverable, there is not as much literature such as official scientific papers or publications. The main source of information will be the scientific deliverable, e.g. for the equations describing the gravitational law. Next to that, the official Unity Documentation (linked in \cite{UnityDoc}) will be used for any further documentation regarding Unitys API. \\ 
The technical deliverable will provide some key features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Gravity}: According to the Newtonian gravitational law. Further details will be in the scientific part of the report.
	\item \emph{Real scale}: The scale of the objects in the solar system will correspond to their actual scale in the real solar system. This will (hopefully) ensure a higher degree of realism and ease gravitational calculations, which are based on the distances.
	\item \emph{Realistic lighting}: As the sun is more or less the only high intensity light source in the solar system, the simulation will use a point light source which will shine light from the suns position. 
	\item \emph{User controllable Satellite}: This will help the user experience navigating a satellite in a three dimensional solar system with objects influencing the trajectory of the space probe.
\end{itemize}
The program will eventually include a Graphical User Interface, for which some parameters are needed. So far it is planned to include the parameters for two objects, mainly x-y-z position of the objects. It will be determined in this section, which data is going to be displayed in a light-weight interface, which provides the user enough information for controlling a satellite and camera (exact number of cameras to be determined in the report). For example, the data, currently planned to be displayed are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Velocity of user controlled camera: Measure how fast the user is going in the solar system
	\item Velocity of the satellite: Enable the user to calculate where the space probe will be when.
	\item Distance of the satellite to the sun: Locate the position of the satellite
	\item Coordinates of the satellite: Locate the satellite in a three-dimensional space
	\item Coordinates of the camera: Locate the user controlled camera in three-dimensional space
	\item Distance camera – Sun: Locate the camera on a relative basis in the solar system
	\item Labels of the planets: Locate the planets relative to the camera
	\item Planet orbit paths: Locate the orbits of the planets
	\item Satellite trajectory: Display the points, the satellite already passed to estimate the further trajectory
\end{itemize}
As the user will be able to control the camera, it will be required for this project, to map keys on the keyboard to certain movements, to enable the user to experience the virtual solar system. As of now, the keys are mapped as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item W – Forwards movement relative to current rotation
	\item A – Left movement relative to current rotation
	\item S – Backwards movement relative to current rotation
	\item D – Right movement relative to current rotation
	\item Shift-Left – Upwards movement relative to current rotation
	\item Ctrl-Left – Downwards movement relative to current rotation
	\item Arrow Key Left – Rotation Left (Z-Axis)
	\item Arrow Key Right – Rotation Right (Z-Axis)
	\item Arrow Key Up – Rotation Upwards (X-Axis)
	\item Arrow Key Down – Rotation Downwards (X-Axis)
\end{itemize}
Also the  satellite will be controllable by the user, to ensure, that the user gets a better understanding of the complexity of navigating in a three-dimensional space under the influence of gravitational pull to other celestial bodies. 



% \subsection{Constraints}
% Provide all the constraints that were to be considered for the project.
% A constraint is a property that is agreed by you and your PAT to have been satisfied before starting the project.
% An example could be ``good level in Python programming''. 
% As a consequence the work done to satisfy the constraints cannot be presented as a deliverable of the BSP.

\section{Pre-requisites} 
Although all concepts used in the report will be explained in the report, it could be helpful, yet not mandatory, to understand the basic notions of the following topics. These are already known by the author before starting. 
\subsection{Scientific pre-requisites}
Before starting the Bachelor Semester Project, the student had some experience in orbital mechanics, which includes the basics of (gravitational) force vectors. \\
Next to that, the student had some experience in constructing mathematical and physical models with certain simplifications for computational ease.
\subsection{Technical pre-requisites}
As the technical deliverable is about the implementation of a basic solar system simulation in Unity, the student already knows how to work with Unitys' scaling, transformation and rotation system and their script application programming interfaces (APIs) in C\#. Also the basics of game and simulation development are known, as it was part of a small course in the Computer Science Summer Camp at Hochschule Trier.

\section{A computational model}
\label{sec-computational-model}
\subsection{Requirements (122/150 words)}
The requirement for this section is to explain with the given resources, the concept of a computational model. This includes the fundamental basics of how it came to be, as well as some insights on how they are usually developed and the scientific significance of them. For the explanation, it should be well understandable to any person, who understands the basics of computer science and is willing to read this bachelor semester project. This is to ensure that the author has well understood the topics of this section, as it will be the fundament of the upcoming sections and the technical part.\\
The results of this section will provide a step by step way to build a computational model of any kind. 
\subsection{Design (213/300 words)}
As there are only few resources providing a general overview on computational models, this section of the report will mainly be consisting of information found in \cite{ComputationalModelsIntroduction}.\\
Here, the following chapters will be used for finding results to the above scientific question:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chapter 1: Problem Solving and Computing:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1.1: This is useful for finding the motivation for computational models. It explains the fundamental issue and already hints at, what is needed to develop such a model.
		\item 1.2: As it is also the goal of this report to find a step by step set of instructions for building a computational model, this section already provides a basic skeleton for this set of instructions. \\
		Regarding \ref{sec-computational-model}, the outline of steps will be used to construct a more detailed instruction set than given in the resource. 
		\item 1.3: This section will be used to find different ways to tackle different mathematical difficulties. It will help to set up a guideline for transforming the mathematical model with formulas into a computational model with algorithmic approaches. 
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}
Next to these information, the observations made during the first weeks of the semester in the development of the application will be used. This will not only provide meaningful results, but also show the real world development of the models.
\subsection{Production (0/400 words)}
Provide descriptions of the deliverables concrete production. It must present part of the deliverable (e.g. source code extracts, scientific work extracts, \ldots) to illustrate and explain its actual production.
\subsection{Assessment (0/150 words)}
Provide any objective elements to assess that your deliverables do or do not satisfy the requirements described above. 


\section{Transforming physics and observations to mathematics}
\label{sec-modeling}
\subsection{Requirements (85/150 words)}
This section will be containing the a list of formulas and iterative approaches, as well as considerations to which approach is chosen in the end for the project. It will take real physics formulas and compare them to iterative functions for calculating the same thing with a certain precision. Here it is required to be precise about the reasons why a certain way is chosen for the technical deliverable over another one. A computational model according to \ref{sec-computational-model} will be modelled with high (floating point) precision formulas.
\subsection{Design (148/300 words)}
As section \ref{sec-computational-model} already contains a detailed look at computational models and computational modelling, this section will use the results of section \ref{sec-computational-model} and combine it with the formulas describing the solar system. This will then provide a mathematical/computational model of the solar system, for which the goal is to model algorithmic approaches to emulate the behaviour of the solar system. This modelling will be step by step according to the guideline found in \ref{sec-computational-model} and will illustrate the use of it on this example. \\
Additionally, next to the chapters used in the preceding section, this section will use the following sections of Chapter 1 of \cite{ComputationalModelsIntroduction}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1.4: As this section is a more detailed description of Computational modelling with more details on the development process, which are not needed in \ref{sec-computational-model}.
	\item 1.8: Section 1.8 provides a software development approach to the problem of computational models.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Production (0/400 words)}

\subsection{Assessment (0/150 words)}
Provide any objective elements to assess that your deliverables do or do not satisfy the requirements described above. 

\section{Simplifications for ease of computations}
\label{sec-simplify}
\subsection{Requirements (64/150 words)}
This section will contain simplifications to the formulas found in \ref{sec-modeling}.\\
It will also be required to take certain observations into account for simplifying the formulas. It will be required to be clear and well explained why these simplifications can and have to be made. This will include a critical computer scientific standpoint as well as a critical standpoint from the point of physics.
\subsection{Design (95/300 words)}
This section will take a look at the scale of the numbers used in the model developed in \ref{sec-modeling} and point out floating point and precision issues. Furthermore it will simplify some equations for ease of computation and also simplify some behaviour into constants.\\
Specifically, this section will use Chapter 1 of \cite{ComputationalModelsIntroduction}. Section 1.11 of this chapter is especially important, as it provides the necessary information regarding floating point precision, errors and accuracy. \\
To find issues in precision, the sections \ref{sec-computational-model} and \ref{sec-modeling} will be used to show the errors or complex calculation made.
\subsection{Production (0/400 words)}
Provide descriptions of the deliverables concrete production. It must present part of the deliverable (e.g. source code extracts, scientific work extracts, \ldots) to illustrate and explain its actual production.
\subsection{Assessment (0/150 words)}
Provide any objective elements to assess that your deliverables do or do not satisfy the requirements described above.

\label{sec-solar system}
\subsection{Requirements (0/150 words)}
In this section it is required to find explanations and pseudocode for the implementation of the solar system. This section will focus on the implementation of the "stable orbit script" (SOS) which is mainly responsible for the elliptical orbits in this system. It will also be required to look at the results from \ref{sec-modeling} and \ref{sec-simplify} as they provide the \emph{theoretical} aspects of this part. With these as the main points covered, it will also be necessary to take a look at the game objects and the addition of a script to such an object. This will include a detailed glimpse at Unitys scripting API.

\section{Movement in three dimensions and time control}
\label{sec-movement-in-3D}
\subsection{Requirements (60/150 words)}
This section will be mostly about the camera, camera controller and the time controller scripts of the Unity project. It will focus on the coding aspects as well as some mathematical background from Linear Algebra, such as Vectors and point transformations. Since this section is not based on physics, it does not rely on results from \ref{sec-modeling} and \ref{sec-simplify}.

\section{Satellite and gravity}
\label{sec-satellite-gravity}
\subsection{Requirements (79/150 words)}
For this section it is required to provide the most important explanations on how Gravity and the satellite object are implemented in the editor. This includes (Pseudo-)Code snippets for the most important functions. Also section \ref{sec-movement-in-3D} has to be taken into account, as also the satellite object has to move in three dimensions. \\
Most importantly, this section takes results from \ref{sec-modeling} and \ref{sec-simplify} to provide an answer to the question: \emph{How is satellite movement implemented in this program?}

\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.
\section{Plagiarism statement}

I declare that I am aware of the following facts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item As a student at the University of Luxembourg I must respect the rules of intellectual honesty, in particular not to resort to plagiarism, fraud or any other method that is illegal or contrary to scientific integrity.
	\item My report will be checked for plagiarism and if the plagiarism check is positive, an internal procedure will be started by my tutor. I am advised to request a pre-check by my tutor to avoid any issue.
	\item As declared in the assessment procedure of the University of Luxembourg, plagiarism is committed whenever the source of information used in an assignment, research report, paper or otherwise published/circulated piece of work is not properly acknowledged. In other words, plagiarism is the passing off as one’s own the words, ideas or work of another person, without attribution to the author. The omission of such proper acknowledgement amounts to claiming authorship for the work of another person. Plagiarism is committed regardless of the language of the original work used. Plagiarism can be deliberate or accidental.
	Instances of plagiarism include, but are not limited to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Not putting quotation marks around a quote from another person’s work
		\item Pretending to paraphrase while in fact quoting
		\item Citing incorrectly or incompletely
		\item Failing to cite the source of a quoted or paraphrased work
		\item Copying/reproducing sections of another person’s work without acknowledging the source
		\item Paraphrasing another person’s work without acknowledging the source
		\item Having another person write/author a work for oneself and submitting/publishing it (with permission, with or without compensation) in one’s own name (‘ghost-writing’)
		\item Using another person’s unpublished work without attribution and permission (‘stealing’)
		\item Presenting a piece of work as one’s own that contains a high proportion of quoted/copied or paraphrased text (images, graphs, etc.), even if adequately referenced
	\end{enumerate}
	Auto- or self-plagiarism, that is the reproduction of (portions of a) text previously written by the author without citing that text, i.e. passing previously authored text as new, may be regarded as fraud if deemed sufficiently severe.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]

%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]

%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%

%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

% trigger a \newpage just before the given reference
% number - used to balance the columns on the last page
% adjust value as needed - may need to be readjusted if
% the document is modified later
